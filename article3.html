                <p>
                    Stanford University was founded in 1885 and is located in
                    California's Bay Area, around 30 miles south of San
                    Francisco. More than half of the student body studies at the
                    graduate level. Seven schools comprise the university, many
                    of which are highly ranked for graduate-level studies. Three
                    of the schools offer both undergraduate and graduate
                    degrees: humanities and sciences; earth sciences; and
                    engineering. The business, law, education and medical
                    schools offer only graduate-level degrees. Stanford’s
                    academic calendar is based on a quarter system and the
                    language of instruction is English.

                    Around 8 percent of the undergraduate student body is
                    international, as is around 30 percent of the graduate
                    student population. Housing is guaranteed for four years for
                    undergraduates who enter as freshmen, and more than 90
                    percent of undergrads live on campus. Stanford also
                    guarantees first-year housing for new graduate students.
                    More than 60 percent of graduate students live on campus, as
                    well as around 30 percent of faculty members. Stanford’s
                    library system, which supports 20 libraries, comprises more
                    than 9.3 million physical volumes. Research funding at
                    Stanford has topped $1 billion, including funds from the
                    federal government for projects at the SLAC National
                    Accelerator Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy lab
                    operated by Stanford. Scientists from all over the world –
                    around 3,400 of them annually – take advantage of SLAC’s
                    facilities. Upward of 1,000 scientific papers based on
                    research conducted at the lab are published each year
